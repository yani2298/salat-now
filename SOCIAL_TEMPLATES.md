Title: Released Islamic Prayer Times Calculator as Professional TypeScript Library

Just published a production-ready Islamic prayer times calculation library that I extracted from my macOS menu bar app project.

‚Ä¢ Built-in caching with configurable TTL
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive error handling
‚Ä¢ Current prayer detection with countdown timers

const calculator = new SalatTimesCalculator();
const times = await calculator.getPrayerTimes({
  city: 'Paris',
  country: 'France',
  calculationMethod: CalculationMethod.ISNA
});

const current = calculator.getCurrentPrayer(times);
console.log(`Current: ${current.name}, Next: ${current.next.name}`);
